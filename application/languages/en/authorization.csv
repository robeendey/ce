"AUTHORIZATION_VIEWS_SCRIPTS_ADMINLEVEL_DESCRIPTION";"Member levels can be used to give certain members more privileges than others. You can grant/restrict a member level's access to features, sections of the community. You can also assign levels that have moderation or administrative capabilities.<br /><br />One of your member levels must be marked as the ""default level"". When new members sign up, they will automatically belong to this level. You can change a specific member's level by editing their account details from the %s page. If you want all members in your community to have the same features and limits, you will only need a single member level (aside from the Super Admin level)."
