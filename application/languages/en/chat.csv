"CHAT_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_GLOBAL_GENERALDELAY_DESCRIPTION";"The chatroom application connects to your server (using AJAX) every few seconds to get new data. How often do you want this process to occur? A shorter amount of time will make the chat slightly faster but will also consume more server resources. If your server is experiencing slowdown issues, try increasing this value from the default (5,000 milliseconds). Please enter a number between 1,000 and 100,000 (milliseconds)."
